# SalesAnalysis-ElectronicsStore

In this repo, 12 months of sales data of an electronics store will be analysed and certain business questions will be answered based on the analysis.
Python Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries will be used for the exploratory analysis.

The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

Analysis consists of four main parts:

**Part 1** : Understanding the Datasets

**Part 2** : Combining the csv files and the dataframes

**Part 3** : Data cleaning

**Part 4** : Business Questions


The business related question are;

* What was the best month for sales and how much was earned in that month?
* Which city had the highest amount of sales?
* What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
* Which products are most often sold together? *(find pythonic ways to explore the bundles)*
* Which product was sold the most and why?

12 months [sales data](https://github.com/musster/SalesAnalysis-ElectronicsStore/tree/main/SalesData) is available as csv files and you can also make your own analysis on the same data sets.
